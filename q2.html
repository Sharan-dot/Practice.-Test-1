            <h1>Key Differences Between Writing in Google Docs and HTML</h1>

            <h2>1. Formatting Flexibility</h2>
            <p>Google Docs offers a user-friendly interface with a variety of formatting tools readily available. You can easily format text with just a few clicks. On the other hand, in an HTML document, formatting requires knowledge of specific HTML tags, which makes it less intuitive but far more customizable.</p>

            <h2>2. Visual Interface vs. Code-Based Writing</h2>
            <p>Google Docs is where you see how your document looks as you write. In contrast, writing in HTML requires you to write code, and you wonâ€™t see the final output until the HTML is rendered by a browser.</p>

            <h2>3. Collaboration Features</h2>
            <p>Google Docs excels at real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to edit a document simultaneously. HTML documents, while shareable and editable, do not inherently support this level of collaboration unless hosted on platforms that facilitate version control, like GitHub.</p>

            <h2>4. Purpose</h2>
            <p>Google Docs is primarily for document creation and sharing, with features for easy text editing, collaboration, and exporting. HTML is primarily used for web development, with the goal of structuring content to be displayed on web pages.</p>
